0. [flux architecture, adhesive, hot-reload]
1. when I am viewing a view and another user deletes the model I am viewing, or deletes a model from the collection I am viewing, what to do?
2. fix backbone nested models
3. problem is that checkbox is not switching locally, it is appearing in other browsers with the correct value, but the GUI value is not toggling


notes:

1. using pure 'change' event for Adhesive is working because the code to set the checkbox is running one more time than otherwise. 
For some reason the checkbox seems to check itself or uncheck itself preventing toggling behavior.
